Dua Lipa has become one of the biggest pop stars in the world in recent years. The British singer-songwriter has had multiple chart-topping hits and has won several awards, including two Grammy Awards. In this exclusive interview, Dua Lipa discusses her musical influences, her creative process, and her plans for the future.

Q: You've cited artists like Nelly Furtado and Pink as influences. What is it about their music that inspires you?

A: I love the way they both incorporate different genres into their music. Nelly Furtado was one of the first artists I listened to who mixed pop and hip-hop, and I think that really influenced the way I approach my own music. And Pink has always been such a badass, with her rock-infused pop sound and powerful vocals. I think both of them have had a big impact on the kind of artist I want to be.

Q: You've had several hit singles over the past few years. What's your creative process like when writing new music?

A: It varies from song to song, but usually I'll start with a melody or a concept and build from there. I love collaborating with other writers and producers, and I think that's where some of my best work has come from. I always want to make sure that my music is authentic and true to who I am, so I'm very involved in the production and mixing process as well.

Q: Your music has been praised for its empowering messages. How important is it for you to use your platform to speak up about issues like feminism and LGBTQ+ rights?

A: It's incredibly important to me. I think as artists, we have a responsibility to use our platform to raise awareness about issues that matter. I've always been passionate about gender equality and LGBTQ+ rights, and I want my music to reflect that. I've been lucky enough to have a lot of support from my fans, and I want to use that support to make a positive difference in the world.

Q: What can fans expect from your upcoming projects?

A: I've been working on a lot of new music, and I'm really excited for everyone to hear it. I think it's a natural evolution from my first album, but it also explores some new sounds and themes. I've also been working on some collaborations that I'm really excited about. It's been a challenging year for everyone, and I hope my music can bring some joy and positivity into people's lives.

Q: What advice do you have for aspiring musicians?

A: The most important thing is to be true to yourself and your own vision. There's so much pressure in the industry to conform to certain trends or sounds, but I think the most successful artists are the ones who stay true to themselves. Also, don't be afraid to take risks and try new things. You never know where your next hit song might come from!
