# Magazineklert

Magazineklert is a sample magazine template created with Astro.js. This project aims to demonstrate the power of markdown in creating articles and blogs for magazines. To enhance the user experience and make the page more visually engaging, Gsap is utilized to incorporate motion and scroll triggers on the site.

## Features

- Markdown-based Articles: Magazineklert leverages the flexibility and simplicity of markdown to create rich articles and blog posts. Markdown allows you to focus on the content while still maintaining a visually appealing format.

- Astro.js: The template is built using Astro.js, a modern static site generator that allows you to combine different technologies and frameworks to create performant and scalable websites. Astro.js provides a seamless development experience and enables efficient server-side rendering.

- Gsap Animation: To add interactivity and visual interest, Gsap (GreenSock Animation Platform) is used. Gsap is a powerful animation library that offers a wide range of features and capabilities. It allows you to create smooth animations, scroll-triggered effects, and stunning transitions to enhance the overall user experience.
